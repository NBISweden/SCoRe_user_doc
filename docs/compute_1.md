# Resources

!!! warning "This page is a stub"

    As of now, this page is incomplete, possibly incorrect and
    open for [contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md).

There are multiple types of [resources](resources.md) you may need.
This page is about finding a place to run heavy calculations on:
it shows a flowchart how to determine the computational resource
you can use, followed by an overview of all resources.

## Selecting the computational resource you can use

```mermaid

  sensitive_data[Do you work with sensitive data?]
  compute_ai[Do you focus on AI?]

  sens_compute_location[Where are you located?]
  compute_location[Where are you located?]

???- question "Why is this a useful resource?"

    This page is the only page that combines all the computational resources
    of all the different providers.

???- question "How is this list generated and updated?"

    On a daily basis,
    [the `update_content.yaml` continuous integration script](https://github.com/NBISweden/SCoRe_user_doc/blob/main/.github/workflows/update_content.yaml)
    checks the websites of the course providers and updates the list,
    using [the `scoreto` R package](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/scoreto).

???- question "A compute provider is missing!"

    If a compute provider is missing, please [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)
    or [contact us](contact_us.md).

???- question "My compute resource is absent!"

    If your compute resource is absent, please [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)
    or [contact us](contact_us.md).

???- question "My compute resource can be displayed better!"

    If your compute resource can be displayed better,
    please [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)
    or [contact us](contact_us.md).

???- question "How can I read this data is a machine-friendly format?"

    Most of this information can be
    [downloaded as a `.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NBISweden/SCoRe_user_doc/refs/heads/main/docs/compute.csv).
