## List of courses

???- question "Why is this a useful resource?"

    This page is the only page that combines all the courses of all the
    different providers.

???- question "How is this list generated and updated?"

    On a daily basis,
    [the `update_courses.yaml` continuous integration script](https://github.com/NBISweden/SCoRe_user_doc/blob/main/.github/workflows/update_courses.yaml)
    checks the websites of the course providers and updates the list,
    using [the `scoreto` R package](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/scoreto).

???- question "What does the :warning: mean?"

    It means that the course provider has supplied a broken course URL.

???- question "My course is missing!"

    If your course is missing, please [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)
    or [contact us](contact_us.md).

???- question "My course can be displayed better!"

    If your course can be displayed better,
