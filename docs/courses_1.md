## List of courses

???- question "How is this list generated and updated?"

    On a daily basis,
    [the `update_courses.yaml` continuous integration script](https://github.com/NBISweden/SCoRe_user_doc/blob/main/.github/workflows/update_courses.yaml)
    checks the websites of the course providers and updates the list,
    using [the `scoreto` R package](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/scoreto).

    If your course is missing,
    either [create an issue at the `scoreto` R package](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/scoreto/issues)
    or [contact us](contact_us.md).
