# Courses

!!! warning "This page is a stub"

    As of now, this page is incomplete, possibly incorrect and
    open for [contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md).

There are multiple types of [resources](resources.md) you may need.
Knowledge is a resource too.
This page shows the places to increase your knowledge in a learning
environment,
as provided by courses and training.

## List of courses

???- question "Why is this a useful resource?"

    This page is the only page that combines all the courses of all the
    different providers.

    Additionally, it can be used to

    - Detect broken links to courses, as indicated by the :warning:
      emoji
    - Detect inconsistencies when the same course is advertised by multiple
      providers, as the same course will be displayed multiple times

???- question "How is this list generated and updated?"

    On a daily basis,
    [the `update_courses.yaml` continuous integration script](https://github.com/NBISweden/SCoRe_user_doc/blob/main/.github/workflows/update_courses.yaml)
    checks the websites of the course providers and updates the list,
    using [the `scoreto` R package](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/scoreto).

???- question "What does the :warning: mean?"

    It means that the course provider has supplied a broken course URL.

???- question "My course is missing!"

    If your course is missing, please [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)
    or [contact us](contact_us.md).

???- question "My course can be displayed better!"

    If your course can be displayed better,
    please [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)
    or [contact us](contact_us.md).

???- question "My course is displayed twice!"

    The same course can be listed by multiple providers.
    If so, this page will show the same course muliple times.
    This is intentional: it allows a course provider to check
    if all course information is shared identical across the providers.
