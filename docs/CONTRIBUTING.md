## Improvements to the Courses page

[The Courses page](https://nbisweden.github.io/SCoRe_user_doc/courses/)
scrapes the websites of course providers,
using [the `scoreto` R package](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/scoreto).
However, not all course providers give information about their
courses in a machine-friendly way. This can cause courses to not be picked
or, or be displayed incorrectly.

Things that will be fixed are:

- A course is not picked up from a provider's site 

Things that will not be fixed are:

- A course URL, as copied from a provider's site, is broken.
