## Improvements to the Courses page

[The Courses page](courses)
scrapes the websites of course providers,
using [the `scoreto` R package](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/scoreto).

Not all course providers give information about their
courses in a machine-friendly way. This can cause courses to be
(1) not being scraped, or (2) being displayed incorrectly.

Things that will be fixed are:

- A course is not scraped from a provider's site
- A course is displayed unexpectedly weird

Things that will not be fixed are:

- A course URL, as copied from a provider's site, is broken.
  These URLs are indicated in the table with a :warning: emoji
